# A Teeny Tiny compiler

Implemented a small compiler in c++ for the language "Teeny Tiny" which is a dialect of BASIC that compiles to C. 
Following the posts of: https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html

The language allows a variety of the basic operations that you'd expect from a programming language. In particular, it supports:

- Numerical variables
- Basic arithmetic
- If statements
- While loops
- Print text and numbers
- Input numbers
- Labels and goto
- Comments
