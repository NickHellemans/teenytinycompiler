# A Teeny Tiny compiler

Implementing a small compiler in c++ for the language "Teeny Tiny" which is a dialect of BASIC that will compile to C. 
Following the posts of: https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html

The language will allow a variety of the basic operations that you'd expect from a programming language. In particular, it supports:

- Numerical variables
- Basic arithmetic
- If statements
- While loops
- Print text and numbers
- Input numbers
- Labels and goto
- Comments

Although this is a standard subset of features, you may notice that there are no functions, no arrays, no way to read/write from a file, and not even an else statement. 
But with just this small set of constructs, you can actually do a lot. These features can be added later.
